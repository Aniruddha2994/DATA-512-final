    "### Motivation\n",
    "UFC is world's biggest mixed martial arts event. There are a total of over 170 different martial art forms, each focusing on either grappling or striking, punches or kicks or a maixture of these integrated in one. In UFC, fighters from diverse backgrounds trained in different forms of martial arts battle for the championship in short rounds of 5 minutes. In these high intensity quick bouts, it is the fighting style and technique that determine the winner. \n",
    "This project aims at analysing the UFC matches data to determine the most efficient fighting styles in UFC. "

    "### Project Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze the effectiveness of various fighting styles used by fighters in UFC\n",
    "1. Exploratory data analysis\n",
    "2. Devise a metric to quantify efficiency of a fighting style\n",
    "3. Identify the most efficient fighting style across different weight categories and match time\n",
    "4. Build a model that will predict who will win a match based on their fighting style along with other relevant features (if time permits)\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis will help in understanding which fighting style is efficient in a given match setting. It can also help provide an insightful comparison between champions from different era by analyzing their preferred style of combat."
